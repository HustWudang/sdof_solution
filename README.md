-----
To use this program, users should : see the folder "exp".
[1] prepare the "input.txt" file (the instruction is in "input_instruction.txt").
[2] compile and run the program in the same path with the "input.txt" file.
[3] The displacement and velocity of the mass point is recorded in "output.txt" file within the same folder.
