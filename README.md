# sdof_solution
Test different time integration approaches for single degree of freedom (SDOF) system.
-----
To use this program, users should : see the folder "exp".
[1] prepare the "input.txt" file (the instruction is in "input_instruction.txt").
[2] compile and run the program in the same path with the "input.txt" file.
[3] Analysis mode : 1-original Newmark approach; 2-Newmark-Predictor-Corrector approach.
[4] The displacement and velocity of the mass point is recorded in "output_Newmark.txt" and "output_NPC.txt" file within the same folder.
-----
The Newmark-Predictor-Corrector(NPC) time integration approach was added for SDOF problem.
The original Newmark time integration approach was added for SDOF problem.
